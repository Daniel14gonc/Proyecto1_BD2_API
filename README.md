# Twitter clone

We built a web application inspired by Twitter. The main goal of the project was learning about the NoSQL database model.
The app included features from the original Twitter, like a feed with tweets from different people. You could create your own
user and start tweeting. You could like and comment in posts. And you had your own history of tweets.

## Tools 🔧

- MongoDB 🍃
- Flask 🌶️
- React ⚛️

## Results

Here you can take a look at the UI of the application
